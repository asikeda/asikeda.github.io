			<p id="about-intro">Hi! You can call me A for now, and I want to be your new apprentice. I put this site together from scratch in HTML, CSS, and jQuery over the last week as my application to show you why I would be an excellent fit for the position. I hope you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed making it!</p>
			<p>My interests span (pun semi-intended) a wide enough range that I’ve never been able to pursue all of them as fully as I would like to. I chose my undergraduate majors at UC Berkeley &#40;Ethnic Studies and Gender &#38; Women’s Studies&#41; based on what felt non-negotiable to me: I could live without involvement in STEM fields, but I can’t live without daily practices of social justice. Still, having to choose one trajectory over another has always felt like a sacrifice I wish I didn’t have to make.</p>
			<p>I've been drawn to Design Action Collective since the Empowering Womxn of Color Conference in March 2015. I participated in a workshop on visual communication and social movements led by Andrea, Poonam, and Ivy just months after I had designed and programmed my first website in a 12-week, student-taught class that left me hungry for more. Knowing that a talented group of designers and developers centered their values and politics in their work was &#40;and still is&#41; unbelievably inspiring and thrilling to me. Pursuing graphic and web design post-graduation was just beginning to feel like an actual possibility, and meeting members of your team gave me hope that I might yet be able to develop my talents without having to compromise on my beliefs. <a class="ext-link" href="https://m.popkey.co/266f09/MwxLL.gif" target="_blank">This is how I felt</a> when I saw that you're looking for an entry-level web developer.</p>
			<p>As Operations Director &#38; Production Assistant at Aunt Lute Books, I’m constantly balancing a wide variety of projects and working among a small, value-driven team. On the operations side, I develop and maintain organizational systems essential to running a nonprofit publishing press, including handling sales, returns, inventory, and distributor relations. For production, I design book interiors, typeset our manuscripts, and track the day-to-day progress of our copyediting and proofreading team. My responsibilities require exacting attention to detail, understanding of informational organization, flexibility, and skill/knowledge acquisition, all of which I believe will translate beautifully into your web development apprenticeship program.</p>
			<p>While I've been relatively successful at absorbing new design knowledge on my own, teaching myself web development has been much more challenging. The one web design class I've taken focused only on HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Figuring out where to start with the rest has been daunting, especially with designing &#38; developing around a content management system like WordPress without previous experience with things like PHP and MySQL. Maintaining motivation and discipline in my self-designed education also takes a lot of time and energy that I often don't have, but more formal education within the web development field as a whole doesn't feel like an environment in which I could be comfortable as myself. I'm hungry for the kind of training, mentorship, and support your apprenticeship program offers, because I know I have a lot to learn.</p>
			<p id="tldr">tl;dr: I’ve kept an eye out for opportunities to work with you for over two years, my best design work comes from the heart, anti-oppression frameworks inform everything I do, I have a lot of skills and knowledge with plenty of room for more, and I learn fast. Really fast. <a href="mailto:ikedandrea@gmail.com"><span class="pls">Please hire me?</span></a></p>

			<p>I was part of the Fall 2014 volunteer cohort with the <a class="ris" href="http://sfaws.org/" target="_blank">Asian Women's Shelter of San Francisco</a> and participated in a comprehensive 40-hour training on survivor-centered and oppression-informed anti-domestic violence work. While I haven't been able to continue volunteering at the shelter consistently due to capacity limitations, I hope to be able to resume in the near-ish future.</p>
			<p>I often attend classes at <a class="ris" href="http://www.spiralgardens.org/" target="_blank">Spiral Gardens Community Food Security Project</a> and volunteer in the farm/nursery when I'm able to. I'm also in touch with the directors about non-traditional volunteer opportunities there.</p>
			<p>Over the course of the last year or more, I've reflected extensively on what "activism" and "social justice" mean outside of the context of formal participation in organizations and/or direct actions as I've engaged in deep care work with those close to me, and with myself. It's been a process of unraveling oppression from the inside out and transforming the ways oppression shows up in interpersonal relationships, particularly in regards to anti-Blackness, ableism, and classism.</p>

				<p class="pf-body">Of the five Multicultural Student Development offices at UC Berkeley, we were the only office that didn't have a website. I took the Web Design DeCal so that I could make one as my final project for the class, and ended up winning the competition that was judged by faculty members, industry experts, the student instructors, and my classmates. All of the colors adhere to the UC Berkeley identity and branding guidelines. Many of the elements required extensive research beyond what was taught in the class in order to execute properly, such as the circle of intern photos and the color-changing navigation bar.</p>

				<p class="pf-body">For our midterm project in the Web Design DeCal, we were tasked with redesigning the IMDb website and creating mockups using HTML and CSS. The current IMDb website is packed full of information, but doesn't present it in a visually appealing or user-friendly way. Just because it has "database" in the name doesn't mean it should look dull and boring! The homepage and movie page that I designed use a dark theme to evoke the sensation of being in a movie theater and to make the movie images pop, while preserving the characteristic IMDb yellow accent with a sleeker logo.</p>

				<p class="pf-body">The last half of my Graphic Design Studio 1 class focused on developing an identity system for an imaginary business&#8212;we designed logomarks and logotypes, then packaging, then brochures, and then a website. I invented a company called "Seeds of Change" that would partner with local urban farms &#38; urban agriculture organizations to collect seeds from their plants, which would then be packaged in informative envelopes and sold to make grassroots food growth accessible in food deserts and among the most oppressed communities. Even though this was primarily a class exercise rather than an actual business model &#40;and, as it turns out, there's already an organization called Seeds of Change...&#41;, I wanted to channel my design energy into creating something that felt meaningful, worthwhile, and that I would want to support if it actually existed.</p>
